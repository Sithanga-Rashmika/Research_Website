  text: 'The "BlindSafe" application integrates advanced technologies to address the challenges faced by the visually impaired community. One of its core features is fall detection, which utilizes accelerometer and gyroscope sensors with a machine learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, achieving high sensitivity and specificity rates for real-world applicability [1]. Additionally, the app features a medicine identification system, employing the YOLO v8 model for object detection, allowing users to independently identify and manage medications through voice-guided feedback [2]. The injury detection system leverages a CNN model to classify wounds through real-time image processing, further enhancing user safety [3]. Moreover, the public transport navigation assistant combines object detection, distance measurement, and auditory guidance, enabling safe navigation of transit systems by the visually impaired [4]. This multifaceted approach of the BlindSafe application marks a significant advancement in assistive technology, promoting the independence of visually impaired users.',
